# Host Scanner Scripts

This repository hosts several miscellaneous utility scripts for the Host Scanner application.

## `get.sh` and `convert.sh`

The first script downloads all the data files that are required for the various scripts to run. The second one runs the conversions.

## Format

The file format which the source data is converted to is a generic binary format, having the following header:

	┌ uint16      Package type
	├ uint16      Package version
	└[uint32      Number of entries]

The number of entries field is optional, however all files use it currently.

Strings are stored with a leading length indicator, and no trailing `NULL`:

	┌ uint16      String length
	└─ char       Characters

Integer types are encoded using little endian encoding.

## `cpe2hs.go`

Converts NIST's [Official Common Platform Enumeration (CPE) Dictionary](https://nvd.nist.gov/cpe.cfm) to the binary format in use by the application.

Entries other than applications (`a`) and operating systems (`o`) are filtered, since they are not observed by the main application at this time.

### Format

	┌ uint16      Package type [0x0100]
	├ uint16      Package version [0x0100]
	├ uint32      Number of entries
	└┬ uint8      Number of fields in entry
	 ├ string     CPE name
	 ├ string     Vendor
	 ├ string     Product
	 └ string     User-friendly name

## `cpealt2hs.go`

Since NIST's CVE database may use multiple CPE names to refer to the same application, the Debian Security team [compiled a list](https://wiki.debian.org/CPEtagPackagesDep) of CPE aliases for use in their [Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/).

For example, nginx appears as both `cpe:/a:nginx:nginx` and `cpe:/a:igor_sysoev:nginx`, however there are more extreme cases, such as X11, which has 12 CPE names all referring to the same software package.

The alias database is licensed under [MIT License (Expat)](https://www.debian.org/legal/licenses/mit) by the Debian Security team.

### Format

	┌ uint16      Package type [0x0200]
	├ uint16      Package version [0x0100]
	├ uint32      Number of entries
	└┬ uint16     Number of aliases in entry
	 └─ string    CPE name

## `cve2hs.go`

Converts NIST's [National Vulnerability Database (NVD)](https://nvd.nist.gov/download.cfm) to the binary format in use by the application.

Entries not linked via CPE to at least one application or operating system are filtered, since they are of no use during automatic vulnerability discovery.

### Format

	┌ uint16      Package type [0x0500]
	├ uint16      Package version [0x0100]
	├ uint32      Number of entries
	└┬ uint8      Number of fields in entry
	 ├ string     CVE identifier
	 ├ uint16     Severity
	 ├ uint16     Number of vulnerable software
	 └─ string    CPE name

## `zudp2hs.go`

Converts ZMap's [UDP payloads](https://github.com/zmap/zmap/tree/master/examples/udp-probes) to the binary format in use by the application.

### Format

	┌ uint16      Package type [0x0A00]
	├ uint16      Package version [0x0100]
	├ uint32      Number of entries
	└┬ uint16     Number of ports in entry
	 ├─ uint16    Port number
	 └ string     Payload data

## `nudp2hs.go`
